# Processing Code

This is the Processing library. It has a [Firmata](http://firmata.org) dependency, so you will need to install the [processing lib](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Processing), and also install the Firmata firmware on your arduino (in arduino IDE: File -> Open -> Examples > Library-Firmata > StandardFirmata.)

Once you have done these 2 things, put the processing/libraries/arduinoscope folder in your processing libraries folder (on mac: `~/Documents/Processing/libraries`.)

Now, restart processing, and you should have an arduinoscope example (under File/Examples.) This is the source for the stand-alone apps.
