# Processing Code

This is the Processing library. It has a [Firmata](http://firmata.org) dependency, so you will need to install the [processing lib](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Processing), and also install the Firmata firmware on your arduino (in arduino IDE: File -> Open -> Examples > Library-Firmata > StandardFirmata.)

Once you have done these 2 things, put the processing/libraries/arduinoscope folder in your processing libraries folder (on mac: ~/Documents/Processing/libraries)
